orem psum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. orem psum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. t has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. t was popularised in the 1960s with the release of etraset sheets containing orem psum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like ldus ageaker including versions of orem psum.
